# surprising-facts

Todo:
* document how to use notebooks here
* put all necessary resources on gdrive (update comments in notebook parameters sections accordingly)
    * text, transe, complex profile transe and profile complex need new folder for this project
    * random walk embeddings could be copied to folder for this project, or we can link to the folder for the profiling project
    * wikidata-20210215-dwd.claims.wikibase-item.q5.tsv.gz should be moved to gdrive and off of github
    * labels.en file should be either copied to folder for this project, or link to the folder in the profiling project
    * profile_labels_info_joined.RELs_and_AILs.tsv and entity_profile_labels.RELs_and_AILs.shuffled.tsv should be added (with some instructions for how they could be created from the profiling project's ooutput
    * benchmark data should be added to gdrive, though fine to keep them on github
    * 
    
* clean up crowdsource benchmark
* add line for saving final results for both notebooks (both results and predictions)
